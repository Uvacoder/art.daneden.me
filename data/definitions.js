    term: "Vector",
    definition: `
    In the context of these works, a vector refers to a point in two-dimensional
    space. These vectors are made up of X and Y values, and determine position
    or a change in position.

    term: "Perlin Noise",
    definition: `
    Perlin noise is an algorithm that generates pseudo-random values in sequence.
    This means that by stepping through a perlin noise function, you can
    generate values that are somewhat related to one another.

    term: "Processing",
    definition: `
    Processing is &ldquo;a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning
    how to code within the context of the visual arts.&rdquo; In broader terms,
    it is a Java library with a bent on visual output, and is typically the method
    I use for creating generative art. It has an easy learning curve for anyone
    with knowledge of JavaScript. (Take it from me.)

  {
    term: "p5.js",
    definition: `
    p5.js is a JavaScript library loosely based on Processing. It was my first
    introduction to Processing and generative art in general.

    term: "OpenFrameworks",
    definition: `
    OpenFrameworks is a &ldquo;creative coding toolkit&rdquo;, similar to Processing,
    but written in C++. I use it for more computationally taxing pieces.
